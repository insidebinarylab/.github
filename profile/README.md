## InsideBinary Lab

**Reverse Engineering · Binary Analysis · Software Protection**

InsideBinary Lab is a research-driven initiative focused on practical
reverse engineering, real-world protocol analysis, and software protection.
We explore how modern applications work internally — from network protocols
to binary-level mechanisms — and share reproducible, hands-on knowledge.

### Philosophy

We believe effective reverse engineering skills are built through
**real targets, real obstacles, and real-world constraints**.
Our work emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, and practical value
over theoretical discussion.
